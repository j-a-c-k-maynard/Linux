# Hardening Methodology
The developed methodology for hardening an RHEL5 system is to use customized shell
scripts to automate and provide consistency to the security hardening process. The shell scripts
developed are based on the RHEL5 version of the Center for Internet Security (CIS)
Security Configuration Benchmark version 1.1.1, as it provides a consistent and industry
recognized approach to performing security hardening of a RHEL5 system.
CIS provides security consensus benchmarks, scoring tools, and other services and materials
from the CIS website as a public service to Internet users worldwide. Security recommendations
contained within the CIS Benchmark documents result from a consensus-building process that
involves many cross-company security experts, and are generally generic in nature. The
recommendations are intended to provide helpful information and guidance to organizations
attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices. Proper
use of the CIS consensus recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific
business requirements.
